## Game Objective

There is a 52 card deck shuffled onto the screen. The goal is to match all numbers and face cards by remembering the position of cards that were flipped but did not match. If there is a match the two cards stay flipped up, the cards flip back if there is no match. You win the game when all cards are matched and flipped up.


The game begins by pressing start game, and restarts by using the restart button. Difficulty increase adds another 52 cards to the current deck.
